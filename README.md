# Parallel Sorting Algorithms in C

This project implements and compares the performance of sequential and parallel sorting algorithms in C. The sorting algorithm implemented is Insertion Sort.

## Features

***Sequential Implementation**: A baseline sequential implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm.

***Parallel Implementations**:

    ***OpenMP**: A parallel implementation of Insertion Sort using OpenMP for shared-memory parallelism.

    ***pthreads**: A parallel implementation of Insertion Sort using POSIX Threads for multi-threaded execution.

    ***MPI**: A parallel implementation of Insertion Sort using Message Passing Interface for distributed-memory parallelism.

***Benchmarking**: Scripts to automate the process of compiling, running, and measuring the execution time of the different sorting algorithm implementations.
